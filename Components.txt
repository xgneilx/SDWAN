SDN Elements
*Paved the way to scripting "Programming the Network"*

User              - you
     V
Northbound Int   - relay information between the controller and the applications and policy engines 
     V  - Meraki/vManage Dashboard, RESTCONF
SDN Controller    - the core element of an SDN architecture, that enables centralized management and control, automation, and policy enforcement across physical and virtual network environments
     V
Southbound Int   - relay information between the controller and the individual network devices
     V  - Openflow, NETCONF, OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database), SNMP, Meraki (proprietary device‑to‑cloud protocol)
Net Devices       - routers, switches, firewalls, etc.,



Cisco SDWAN Components

1. vManage was introduced as the management plane, where all Day 0, Day 1, and Day N functions will be performed, including WAN Edge
configuration, routing and control policies, troubleshooting, and monitoring.

2. vSmart is the brain of the Cisco SD WAN fabric and is responsible for calculating and deploying all control and data policies as well as handling
the distribution of encryption keys for data plane connectivity.

3. vBond makes up the orchestration plane and is responsible for authenticating components on the fabric in addition to distributing control and
management plane information to the WAN Edges. The vBond is the component that aids in discovery of the fabric for all other components (such
as when devices are behind NAT). The vBond then distributes the connectivity information for the vSmart and vManage to the WAN Edge.


4. vEdge handles the data plane is where user traffic will be routed and forwarded across the WAN. The data plane is similar to routers that would
be deployed in a traditional WAN, though in Cisco SD WAN, these are referred to as WAN Edges.

Each component authenticates each other and if successful, a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) tunnel is established. Separating the
control plane from the data and management plane, the protocol that vSmart uses to communicate all the WAN Edge routing is called Overlay
Management Protocol (OMP)
